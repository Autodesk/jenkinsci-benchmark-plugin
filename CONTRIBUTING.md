**Hi there!**  Weâ€™re thrilled that you are interested to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping this **Benchmark plugin** great and making it even better for all of us.

If you would like to contribute code to the Benchmark plugin, you can do so by following these simple steps.

### Submit your idea
1. Submit your idea by creating a Github `issue`,
2. Associate the `issue` with the right label and project if one related exist.

**Note:** The `issue` is so that the maintainers are aware of your efforts, can comment, and finally, be ready to review and merge your changes.

### Create your own development space
1. Fork this project Github master repository,
2. Create a clone of your fork repository on your development machine,
3. If necessary, create a feature branch based on `master`: `git checkout -b <my-branch-name> master`.

**Note:** Contributions should be developed on branches based off the `master` branch of the Github master repository; and pull requests should be made back towards the `master` branch.

### Make your changes
1. Add the necessary code changes,
2. Add unit tests,
3. Verify that all the existing unit tests pass,
4. Document your code changes (Javadoc & MD files).

### Post your changes for review
1. Push back regularly to your fork, and once the feature is complete to its `master` branch,
2. Submit a pull request towards the `master` branch of the Github master repository; and link the request to its original `issue` in the comment,
3. **Pat yourself in the back** and wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

### How to speed-up the merge of your pull request:
- Follow existing coding practices whenever possible,
- Document your code changes (Javadoc & MD files),
- Write tests and validate existing tests,
- Keep your change as focused as possible,
- When making multiple independent changes, please consider submitting them as separate pull requests,
- With each pull request, consider writing a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
